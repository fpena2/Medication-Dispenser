# Mobile Application
The mobile iOS app in this project is responsible for uploading pill delivery schedules that are made by doctors or healthcare providers (users). The app also downloads output files from the AI. To build the app, we used the SwiftUI programming language. There are 3 main sections of the app: Schedule, History, and Settings

Software Requirement: Xcode installed. 
 
Installation: Download the UI folder, click open a project or file on Xcode and pick the MyPIM folder. Then drag the amplifyconfiguration.json and awsconfiguration.json into the MyPIM folder. (The MyPIM that is mentioned above is not the MyPIM folder inside of this MyPIM)

Warning: The amplify-ios package may be not loaded at the first time you open the project. Plz try several times till the package is loaded in.
